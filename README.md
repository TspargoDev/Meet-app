# Meet-app Project

Welcome to the Meet App! This is a progressive web app that leverages serverless architecture and offline functionality in order for its users to search for events by city at any time-even offline. Using Serverless Architecture and PWA technologies means I'm building an application that is fast, reliably scalable, and available on any device.

Key Features
Filter Events by City: Users can search events by city with helpful suggestions.
Show/Hide Event Details: The details of the events have an expand and collapse toggle.
Specify Number of Events: A user can select how many events they would like to view.
Offline Functionality: Events that have been cached are displayed when there is no internet connection.
Home Screen Shortcut: Can be installed directly onto a users device.
Data Visualization: Charts display how often events take place at a location and within which genres.
Project Approach
React & TDD: The application was built in React and utilizes Test-Driven Development.
Serverless Backend: Utilize AWS Lambda functions instead of a regular server.
Google Calendar API: pulling events securely using OAuth2.
Cross-platform compatible: Optimised for every major browser and device.
Compliance to Progressive Web App: Incl. Service worker to allow for working offline.
App Performance Monitoring: Monitoring app performance by using appropriate tools.
Learning objectives
With this project, I will work with serverless development, PWA standards, TDD, and data visualization. The Meet App is guiding me through how to develop a maintainable, scalable application that is user-friendly and future-ready.

This project has been an opportunity to practically get into modern web development by creating a real-world application while learning critical skills.
